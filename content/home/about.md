# Biography

I am an evolutionary ecologist that uses experiments and genomic tools to answer questions about rapid evolution and community ecology. At the broadest level I am interested in understanding what factors influence the trajectory of populations and ecological communities.  Much of my research centers on understanding the fate of populations and communities in changing environments, with a focus on investigating how rapid evolution shapes ecological dynamics and the persistence of populations. I have particular zest for studying the ecology and evolution that occurs in freshwater ecosystems, but I study several organisms in my research. 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania with [Dr. Paul Schmidt](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/paul-schmidt-lab/). My postdoctoral research is also in collaboration with Dr. Dmitri Petrov at Stanford University. I completed my PhD at the University of British Columbia with [Dr. Dolph Schluter in 2016](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~schluter/wordpress/)
 
My current postdoctoral research seeks to understand when and how rapid evolution shapes populations. I use the model system, Drosophila melanogaster, in outdoor experimental enclosures to experimentally manipulate the pace of evolution with the goal of understanding how genetic changes ultimately influence the fate of populations. In short, we want to know what factors influence whether evolution can rescue populations that are declining due to changing climates. 

My PhD research largely focused on understanding how rapid evolution alters ecological communities in freshwater. This work entailed experiments ranging from entirely ecological studies of trophic cascades to wholly evolutionary work on the genomics of adaptation.
