abstract = "We thank Faith et al. for their informative and thought-provoking reply to our recent article in TREE. We agree with several of their comments regarding the path forward for the study of evosystem services and especially contemporary evosystem services, the topic of our article. Evosystem services are ‘all the uses or services to humans that are produced from the evolutionary process’ including benefits stemming from past, current and future evolution. In our article, we defined ‘contemporary evosystem services’ as ‘the maintenance or increase of an ecosystem service resulting from evolution occurring quickly enough to alter ecological processes’. Here, we briefly discuss two areas where our opinions and working definitions differ from those of Faith et al."
