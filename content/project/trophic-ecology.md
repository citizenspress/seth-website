Having grown up in the great lakes region much of my research is motivated by a desire to understand the rapid evolution, ecology, and physiology of freshwater organisms.

A part of my research in this area has focused on understanding population level-variation in fish physiology.  Understanding the extent and pace over which Intraspecific variation in physiology evolves is crucial to being able to predict the pace of evolution and population persistence in the populations that are often isolated.  An extension of my interest in this area is in quantifying the contribution of rapid evolution to ecosystem services in freshwater ecosystems.

From local adaptation in salmonids to rapid evolution of Daphnia that leads to remediation of algal blooms there is a wealth of suggestive evidence of the benefits that we derive from rapid evolution.  These ‘evosystem services’ present an avenue to manage ecosystems to ensure ecosystem services are maintained for future generations.
