abstract = "Animal pigmentation plays a key role in many biological interactions, including courtship and predator avoidance. Sympatric benthic and limnetic ecotypes of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) exhibit divergent pigment patterns. To test whether differential predation by cutthroat trout contributes to the differences in pigmentation seen between the ecotypes, we used a within‐generation selection experiment on F2 benthic–limnetic hybrids. After 10 months of differential selection, we compared the pigmentation of fish under trout predation to control fish not exposed to trout predation. We found that stickleback exhibited more lateral barring in ponds with trout predation. Ponds with trout were also less turbid, and a greater degree of barring was negatively correlated with the magnitude of turbidity across pond replicates. A more benthic diet, a proxy for habitat use, was also correlated with greater lateral barring and green dorsal pigmentation. These patterns suggest that differential exposure to cutthroat trout predation may explain the divergence in body pigmentation between benthic and limnetic ecotypes."

Evolution can occur quickly; sometimes quickly enough to cause changes in ecological communities. Yet, our understanding of how, when, and why rapid evolution shapes ecology is still very rudimentary. Genomic data has greatly advanced many areas of study in biology and in this paper we discuss ways to apply genomic data to enhance research on the interplay between rapid evolution and ecology. We focus on using genomics to detect selection, estimate heritabilities of key traits, uncover phenotypes that are rapidly evolving, and determine the predictability of some ecological dynamics. When combined with experimental and observational datasets we believe that genomics can provide additional insight into the study of rapid evolution and ecology.
